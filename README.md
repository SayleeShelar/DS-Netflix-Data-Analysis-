# Netflix Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of Netflix's content dataset to explore various patterns and insights. The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from Kaggle and includes additional columns added manually for further analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about Netflix shows and movies, including details such as:
- **Show ID**: Unique identifier for each show or movie.
- **Type**: Whether the entry is a movie or a TV show.
- **Title**: Title of the show or movie.
- **Director**: The director of the movie or TV show.
- **Country**: The country where the show or movie was produced.
- **Date Added**: The date when the show or movie was added to Netflix.
- **Release Year**: The year the show or movie was released.
- **Rating**: The rating of the show or movie (e.g., TV-MA, PG-13).
- **Duration**: Duration of the show or movie (in minutes or number of seasons).
- **Genres**: Categories or genres the show or movie belongs to (e.g., Documentaries, TV Dramas).
- **Rating Score**: An additional column manually added to the dataset, which provides a score for each show or movie.

## Analysis

The analysis covers several key areas:
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: The dataset was cleaned to remove any unnecessary or blank columns, such as `Additional Info`, which was not provided in the original dataset.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics of the dataset to understand its structure and distribution of various features.
- **Rating Analysis**: Examining the distribution of ratings across different types of content.
- **Release Year Trends**: Insights into how the content release year affects viewership and ratings.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Load the dataset using `pandas.read_csv()` with the appropriate file path.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the data analysis steps and visualizations.
